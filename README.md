# Portfolio Project

This repository contains a collection of code files created for my portfolio. Each code file serves a specific purpose and showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization. Below is a brief description of each code file:

## 1. `Engagement Rate Extraction & Visualization`

This script performs data analysis on a given dataset. It utilizes pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to read and analyze the data, generate insights, and create visualizations. The script provides a template for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks.

## 2. `Client Spec NLP`

This colab code file demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning algorithm using scikit-learn. It includes the necessary steps to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance with nlp visualization through word clouds. 

## 3a. `Payout Analysis - Group Stratification`

This code file is part one of the "Payout Structure Analysis" project. Here I extract, clean, and transform creator data then stratify using the sklearn library. Balance tests are then conducted using spicy.stats. 

## 3b. `Payout Analysis - Testing`

This code file is part two of the "Payout Structure Analysis". Note that testing was conducted using random selections from the groups produced in part 3a, however this portion was omitted for actual use. This code is primarily comprised of conducting and plotting the logistic regression model using skit-learn and matplotlib.

Please refer to the individual code files for more detailed information on each project. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you!
